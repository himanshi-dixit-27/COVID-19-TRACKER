This project uses React JS, JAVASCRIPT ES7, Material-UI, React-leaflet, React-chart-js-2 & numeral (for formatting numbers).
It is built by using functional components. 


We divide it into the following sections:
1. Create Header
2. Info Boxes( Total cases, recovered and deaths)
3. Table (of all countries sorted in descending order of total cases)
4. Chart (Line chart to describe the progression or decline in cases over 120 days)
5. Map (taken from react-leaflet)
6. Deploy (using firebase )
 The data is pulled from https://disease.sh/ and rendered by using .json objects
 
 This application is responsive for all kinds of devices.
