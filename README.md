This project uses React JS, JAVASCRIPT ES7, React-leaflet & numeral (for formatting numbers).
This project is built by using functional components. 


We divide it into following sections:
1. Create Header
2. Info Boxes( Total cases, recovered and deaths)
3. Table (of all countries with total cases)
4. Chart (Line chart to describe the progression or decline in cases)
5. Map (taken from react-leaflet)
6. Deploy (using firebase )
 The data is pulled from https://disease.sh/ and rendered by using .json objects

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
